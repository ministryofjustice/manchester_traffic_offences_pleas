Feature: Audit events for invalid case imports are stored

    Background:
	
	Given fixtures from "bdd_auth" are loaded
	And fixtures from "bdd_auth" are available
        And I am logged into the api interface as "admin"

    Scenario Outline: A case with a missing field fails to import 

        Given fixtures from "<case name>" are available
        When the "case" is posted to the api
        Then the response is "failure"
        And the "case" is not saved
        
        And the "audit event" is saved
        And the "audit event" field "event_type" has the value "import"
        And the "audit event" field "event_subtype" has the value "reason for failure"
        And the "audit event" stack trace is present
        And the "audit event" field "datetime" has the value "just now"
        And the "audit event" contains a hash of the details of the case 

        Examples:
            | case name                 | reason for failure        |
            | case_invalid_missing_urn  | case_invalid_missing_urn  |
            | case_invalid_missing_name | case_invalid_missing_name |

        # By stack trace, I am most keen to get validation error type
