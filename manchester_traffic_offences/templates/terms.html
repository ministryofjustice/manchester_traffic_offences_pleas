<h3>How we use your information</h3>

<p>The magistrates’ courts use and retain personal data entered into the Make a Plea service so magistrates can consider cases and make decisions.</p>
<p>Your information is securely stored within the HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) Libra database. It will be removed and securely destroyed when your case has been completed and there is no reason to retain it further, such as for the purpose of an appeal or enforcement of other penalties.</p>
<p>If you want access to any personal data, please follow the MOJ Subject Access Request procedure (SAR). Under the Data Protection Act 1998 a fee of up to £10 can be charged for processing a SAR. It’s HMCTS policy to charge the full £10 fee.</p>
<p>If you don’t pay any fines, including costs or victim surcharge set by the court within the agreed timescale, we may share your information with the police, civilian enforcement officers or debt enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>We will not share your information with any other organisations unless it is required for the purposes of:</p>

<p>Separately from the personal information entered by those using the service, we also collect site-usage information which allows us to see how the service is being used so we can improve it. This information does not contain any personal data.</p>

<p>It includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>questions, queries or feedback you leave, including your email address if you send a message via feedback</li>
    <li>your IP address, and details of which version of web browser you used</li>
    <li>information on how you use the site, using cookies and page tagging techniques</li>
</ul>

<h3>Where your data is stored</h3>

<p>We store your data on our secure servers in the UK and Ireland. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this.</p>

<h3>Keeping your data secure</h3>

<p>Transmitting information over the internet is generally not completely secure, and we can’t guarantee the security of your data. We do, however, use SSL (secure sockets layer) to encrypt all data transferred to, and received from, our server. We take data security very seriously and take every step to ensure that your data remains private and secure.</p>

<h3>Transmit data at your own risk</h3>

<p>We have procedures and security features in place to try and keep your data secure once we receive it.</p>
<p>We won’t share your information with any other organisations for marketing, market research or commercial purposes, and we don’t pass on your details to other websites.</p>

<h3>Disclosing your information</h3>

<p>We may pass on your personal information if we have a legal obligation to do so.</p>

<h3>How we manage sessions</h3>

<p>This service is for entering your plea for minor driving offences. During this time, personal information about you may be visible to anyone with access to the computer (or other device) you are using.</p>
<p>Your data is held in memory during the duration of the session; it is cleared after 20 minutes of inactivity.</p>

<h3>Data Protection Act 1998</h3>

<p>This service complies with all principles of the DPA 1998. Ministry of Justice (MOJ) is the 'data controller' for the purposes of the Act. However, the information you enter into this service is not automatically transmitted to the MOJ, but is stored in a secure database for auditing purposes until your plea is heard and the outcome agreed by the magistrates. No personal data will be used in testing this service.</p>
<p>Our hosting provider, and MOJ staff responsible for supporting this service, will have access to the server in which all personal information entered into this service is stored. All staff with access to the secure data have MOJ security clearance.</p>
<p>Anyone who believes their personal data is kept within this service has the right to submit a SAR to the MOJ, who will give details of the information stored on the server.</p>

<p>This includes loss of income or revenue, business, profits or contracts, anticipated savings, data, goodwill, tangible property or wasted time in connection with this service or any websites linked to it and any materials posted on it. This condition shall not prevent claims for loss of or damage to your tangible property or any other claims for direct financial loss that are not excluded by any of the categories set out above.</p>
<p>This does not affect our liability for death or personal injury arising from our negligence, nor our liability for fraudulent misrepresentation or misrepresentation as to a fundamental matter, nor any other liability which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.</p>
