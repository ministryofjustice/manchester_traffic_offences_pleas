    Retrieve HMCTS receipt emails from google mail, process them and log the
    results.

    HMCTS will respond with either a Passed or Failed status, as per the email
    subject).

    A Failed status means HMCTS have been unable to match a submission with
    existing Libra court records.

    Several Failed emails may be received before a final Passed status,
    e.g when HMCTS staff finally determine the correct court records for
    the submission.

    However, sometimes a submission will not be matched in which case we'll
    receive a Failed status from HMCTS with no subsequent Passed status.

    If a submission is failed, due to an incorrect hearing date or URN,
    then HMCTS may manually correct the URN or hearing date and respond
    with a Passed status.

    In this instance we pick up the corrected hearing date and/or DOH,
    and update our own records whilst recording that a URN or DOH change
    has been made.

    To associate outbound email submissions with our own records we
    insert the relevant IDs into the body of the outbound email in the
    following format:

    <<<makeaplea-ref: {CaseId}, {CourtEmailCountId}>>>

    HMCTS receipt emails include the reference enabling us to
    know which Case and CourtEmailCount data needs
    to be modified.
